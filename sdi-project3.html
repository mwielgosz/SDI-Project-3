<p>Monster Battle Arena</p>
<p>You have entered a battle arena with 100 Hit Points and 100 Energy. When the gate opens, different monsters will appear and you can either fight them or run away!</p>
<p>Upon accepting the battle, you can choose to attack the monster or to regenerate your HP or Energy. If you do not have any Energy, you will not be able to attack.</p>
<p>The game is over once your HP is 0 or you run away. The goal is to defeat as many monsters as possible without dying. Good luck!</p>
